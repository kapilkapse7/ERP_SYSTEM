# ERP System with React

This project is a ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system interface built using React. It allows for the management of basic business operations efficiently.

## Features

- **Dashboard:** Provides an overview of key metrics and features of the ERP system. It dynamically updates based on changes in product listings. The dashboard also includes inventory tracking, where the text color changes and user get a alert as inventory reaches a below level.

- **Products Management:** This feature provides a comprehensive solution for managing product listings within the ERP system. Users can seamlessly add new products to the system using the "Add Product" functionality, which allows for inputting product details such as name, description, price, and quantity. Additionally, users can edit existing product information and delete products as needed. React Context is leveraged for efficient state management, ensuring real-time updates and smooth interaction. This feature empowers users to maintain an up-to-date inventory and make informed decisions regarding product management.

- **Orders Management:** Facilitates viewing and handling of orders, including order details and status updates.

- **Calendar Feature:** It is implemented within the Orders Management section, allowing admin to track pending deliveries and view deliveries scheduled for a specific day. The calendar provides a visual representation of order delivery dates, enhancing planning and organization for efficient order management.
